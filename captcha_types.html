        <h1 class="head1">Types of CAPTCHA</h1>
        <p>CAPTCHA(Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart)." It's a security
            technique used on websites and online services to distinguish between human users and automated bots.
            CAPTCHAs present challenges that are relatively easy for humans to solve but difficult for computers to
            decipher, ensuring that the user is indeed a human. These challenges can include distorted text, image
            recognition, puzzle solving, and more. The purpose of CAPTCHA is to prevent bots from performing malicious
            activities like spamming or automated attacks on websites.</p>

        <h2 class="head2">Checkbox CAPTCHA</h2>
        <h4 class="text-secondary">Advantages:-</h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>Checkbox CAPTCHAs are easy to understand and complete for most users. They only require a single click
                on the checkbox, making them a quick and simple interaction.</li>
            <li>They have minimal impact on user experience and do not require users to decipher distorted text, solve
                puzzles, or perform complex tasks.</li>
